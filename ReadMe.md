if you just want to see the html,open 'index.html' in './dist'

if you want to build it by yourself, download and do following scripts:

- npm install

- npm start // this will help you update your code changes synchronously

  or

  npm run build  // just build

  Then open dist/index.html and you will see the elements created in src/index.js
